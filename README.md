First Couple of Beginner Ruby Exercises

*Simple Calculator*

The simple calulator is a couple of methods for simple calculations 
I wrote five simple methods that add, subtract, multiply, divide and find exponentials respectively

Each of the method takes two arguments and prints out  a result
Each method also checks if the argument is a number 
If it isnt, it informs the user to "Input a number"
